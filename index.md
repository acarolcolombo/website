<h2>Stories</h2>

Stories can change perspectives, economies, and beliefs.
<br>
Each storyteller can modify the shape of a story.
<br>
Each listener can interpret it based on their own unique background.

This is the beauty of a story.
<br>
As in a book, it is always there unchanging but full of meaning.
<br>
As in folklore, it is in constant change but with the same essence.
