<h2 class="about-name">About me</h2>

     alt="Photo of me looking up at fall leaves in a park.">

I'm from Brazil but I lived for the last five years on three different islands abroad: 
Long Island, Oahu, and Great Britain. 

I love nature; and studied biology and education. 
I worked as a scientist in a lab where I used to wear a white coat and design and do science experiments.  
And I also worked as an educator in a botanical garden where I used to wear hiking boots and explain science to kids.

Currently, I have been working in a social mobility charity that empowers less advantaged students to pursue a Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Maths (STEM) career while supporting diversiy in the STEM. I believe that we can decrease inequality through mentoring and education.

My journey got entangled with the creative writing path in 2021. 

I write childrenâ€™s stories inspired by ideas that pop up while playing with my daughter.
My short stories draw on her Brazilian culture and scientific background.

This website contains some of my stories and scientific papers.
