It is official, I’m a children’s book author! 

Last week was the launch of my book 'The Fable of the Rain'. It was an [online event](https://twitter.com/acarolcolombo/status/1565278541465456642?s=20&t=MnEM-RL2NggyLIsGH_8S_w) including cover revelation, voxpop about the book, and link for purchase. I couldn´t concentrate on my work that day. It isn´t everyday that you launch your first book. 

Yesterday, I got the printed version. What an incredible moment to see my ideas becoming real on paper. Not environmentally friendly but for a children’s book, it is a must.

The book was a result of a creative writing course organised by [Writing on the Wall (WoW)](https://writingonthewall.org.uk/) that I did while I was at home being exclusively a mum (which I know is a privilege!). It was truly an opportunity to rediscover myself and check off a buckelist item. 

This wouldn´t be possible without WoW and great mentoring from [Yvonne Battle-Felton](https://www.yvonnebattlefelton.com/) and illustrations by [Bianca Voicu](https://www.instagram.com/biancav_art/)! 

The inspiration came from playing with my daughter Yara and rethinking about my own childhood. This book reflects on how changing perspectives can bring solutions.

**What is the book about?**

What would you do if it was raining on the day of your picnic birthday party? Naya found the solution after hearing a fable in which the rain disappeared. A story about appreciating diversity (and all of the weather).
