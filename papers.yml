      <p>
      Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes
      meningoencephalitis. There are no prophylactic tools for cryptococcosis.
      Previously, our group showed that a C. neoformans mutant lacking the gene
      encoding sterylglucosidase (Δsgl1) induced protection in both
      immunocompetent and immunocompromised murine models of cryptococcosis.
      Since sterylglucosidase catalyzes degradation of sterylglucosides (SGs),
      accumulation of this glycolipid could be responsible for protective
      immunity. In this study, we analyzed whether the activity of SGs is
      sufficient for the protective effect induced by the Δsgl1 strain. We
      observed that the accumulation of SGs impacted several properties of the
      main polysaccharide that composes the fungal capsule, glucuronoxylomannan
      (GXM). We therefore used genetic manipulation to delete the SGL1 gene in
      the acapsular mutant Δcap59 to generate a double mutant (strain
      Δcap59/Δsgl1) that was shown to be nonpathogenic and cleared from the
      lung of mice within 7 days post-intranasal infection. The inflammatory
      immune response triggered by the Δcap59/Δsgl1 mutant in the lung differed
      from the response seen with the other strains. The double mutant did not
      induce protection in a vaccination model, suggesting that SG-related
      protection requires the main capsular polysaccharide. Finally,
      GXM-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in SGs delayed the
      acute lethality of Galleria mellonella against C. neoformans infection.
      These studies highlighted a key role for GXM and SGs in inducing
      protection against a secondary cryptococcal infection, and, since EVs
      notoriously contain GXM, these results suggest the potential use of Δsgl1
      EVs as a vaccination strategy for cryptococcosis.

      <b>IMPORTANCE:</b> The number of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis is
      around 180,000 per year. The disease is the second leading cause of
      mortality among individuals with AIDS. Antifungal treatment is costly and
      associated with adverse effects and resistance, evidencing the urgency of
      development of both therapeutic and prophylactic tools. Here we
      demonstrate the key roles of polysaccharide- and glycolipid-containing
      structures in a vaccination model to prevent cryptococcosis.

      <p>
      Catalepsy – an immobile state in which individuals fail to change imposed
      postures – can be induced by haloperidol. In rats, the pattern of
      haloperidol-induced catalepsy is very similar to that observed in
      Parkinson’s disease (PD). As some PD symptoms seem to depend on the
      patient’s emotional state, and as anxiety disorders are common in PD, it
      is possible that the central mechanisms regulating emotional and
      cataleptic states interplay. Previously, we showed that haloperidol
      impaired contextual-induced alarm calls in rats, without affecting
      footshock-evoked calls. Here, we evaluated the influence of distinct
      aversive stimulations on the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. First, male
      Wistar rats were subjected to catalepsy tests to establish a baseline
      state after haloperidol or saline administration. Next, distinct cohorts
      were exposed to open-field; elevated plus-maze; open-arm confinement;
      inescapable footshocks; contextual conditioned fear; or corticosterone
      administration. Subsequently, catalepsy tests were performed again.
      Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was verified in all drug-treated animals.
      Exposure to open-field, elevated plus-maze, open-arm confinement,
      footshocks, or administration of corticosterone had no significant effect
      on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Contextual conditioned fear, which is
      supposed to promote a more intense fear, increased catalepsy over time.
      Our findings suggest that only specific defensive circuitries modulate
      the nigrostriatal system mediating the haloperidol-induced cataleptic
      state.

      Flippases are responsible for the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids
      in biological membranes. In the encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus
      neoformans, the putative flippase Apt1 is an important regulator of 
      polysaccharide secretion and pathogenesis in mice by unknown mechanisms.
      In this study, we analyzed the role of C. neoformans Apt1 in intracellular
      membrane architecture and synthesis of polysaccharide and lipids. 
      Analysis of wild type (WT), apt1Δ (mutant) and apt1Δ::APT1 (complemented)
      strains by transmission electron microscopy revealed that deletion of 
      APT1 resulted in the formation of irregular vacuoles. Disorganization 
      of vacuolar membranes in apt1Δ cells was accompanied by a significant 
      increase in the amounts of intra-vacuolar and pigment-containing vesicles.
      Quantitative immunogold labeling of C. neoformans cells with a monoclonal
      antibody raised to a major capsular component suggested impaired 
      polysaccharide synthesis. APT1 deletion also affected synthesis of 
      phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, inositolphosphoryl ceramide, 
      glucosylceramide and ergosterylglycoside. These results reveal novel functions
      of Apt1 and are in agreement with the notion that this putative flippase plays 
      an important role in the physiology of C. neoformans.

    abstract: |
      <p>
      A reduction of dopamine release or D2 receptor blockade in the terminal
      fields of the mesolimbic system, particularly the amygdala, clearly reduces
      conditioned fear. Similar D2 receptor antagonism in the neural substrates 
      of fear in the midbrain tectum attenuates the processing of unconditioned
      aversive information. However, the implications of the interplay between 
      opposing actions of dopamine in the rostral and caudal segments of the 
      dopaminergic system are still unclear. Previous studies from this laboratory
      have reported the effects of dopaminergic drugs on behavior in rats in the
      elevated plus maze, auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded from the
      midbrain tectum, fear-potentiated startle, and conditioned freezing. These
      findings led to an interesting framework on the functional roles of dopamine
      in both anxiety and fear states. Dopamine D2 receptor inhibition in the 
      terminal fields of the mesolimbic dopamine system generally causes 
      anxiolytic-like effects, whereas the activity of midbrain substrates of 
      unconditioned fear are enhanced by D2 receptor antagonists, suggesting 
      that D2 receptor-mediated mechanisms play opposing roles in fear/anxiety
      processes, depending on the brain region under study. Dopamine appears to
      mediate conditioned fear by acting at rostral levels of the brain and regulate
      unconditioned fear at the midbrain level, likely by reducing the sensorimotor
      gating of aversive events.

      <p>
      Brain infection by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans results in an 
      estimated 500,000 human deaths per annum. Colonization of the central 
      nervous system (CNS) by C. neoformans causes different clinical syndromes 
      that involve interaction of a number of fungal components with distinct 
      brain cells. In this manuscript, our literature review confirmed the 
      notion that the Cryptococcus field is expanding rapidly, but also 
      suggested that studies on neuropathogenesis still represent a small 
      fraction of basic research activity in the field. We therefore discussed 
      anatomical and physiological aspects of the brain during infection by C. 
      neoformans, in addition to mechanisms by which brain resident cells interact 
      with the fungus. This review suggests that multiple efforts are necessary 
      to improve the knowledge on how C. neoformans affects brain cells, in order 
      to enable the generation of new therapeutic tools in a near future.

    abstract: |
      <p>
      Background
      A reduction of dopamine release or D2 receptor blockade in the terminal 
      fields of the mesolimbic system clearly reduces conditioned fear. Injections of 
      haloperidol, a preferential D2 receptor antagonist, into the inferior colliculus 
      (IC) enhance the processing of unconditioned aversive information. However, a 
      clear characterization of the interplay of D2 receptors in the mediation of 
      unconditioned and conditioned fear is still lacking.
      Methods
      The present study investigated the effects of intra-IC injections of the 
      D2 receptor-selective antagonist sulpiride on behavior in the elevated plus maze 
      (EPM), auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) to loud sounds recorded from the IC, 
      fear-potentiated startle (FPS), and conditioned freezing.
      Results
      Intra-IC injections of sulpiride caused clear proaversive effects in the EPM 
      and enhanced AEPs induced by loud auditory stimuli. Intra-IC sulpiride 
      administration did not affect FPS or conditioned freezing.
      Conclusions
      Dopamine D2-like receptors of the inferior colliculus play a role in the 
      modulation of unconditioned aversive information but not in the fear-potentiated 
      startle response.

      Dopaminergic mechanisms underlying catalepsy, fear and anxiety: Do they interact?

      <p>
      Haloperidol is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that induces catalepsy when 
      systemically administered to rodents. The haloperidol-induced catalepsy is a 
      state of akinesia and rigidity very similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
      There exists great interest in knowing whether or not some degree of emotionality 
      underlies catalepsy. If so, what kind of emotional distress would permeate such 
      motor disturbance? This study is an attempt to shed some light on this issue 
      through an analysis of ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) of 22 kHz, open-field 
      test, and contextual conditioned fear in rats with some degree of catalepsy 
      induced by haloperidol. Systemic administration of haloperidol caused catalepsy 
      and decreased exploratory activity in the open-field. There was no difference 
      in the emission of USVs between groups during the catalepsy or the exploratory 
      behavior in the open-field test. In the contextual conditioned fear, when 
      administered before training session, haloperidol did not change the emission 
      of USVs or the freezing response. When administered before testing session, 
      haloperidol enhanced the freezing response and decreased the emission of USVs 
      on the test day. These findings suggest that the involvement of dopaminergic 
      mechanisms in threatening situations depends on the nature of the aversive 
      stimulus. Activation of D2 receptors occurs in the setting up of adaptive 
      responses to conditioned fear stimuli so that these mechanisms seem to be 
      important for the emission of 22 kHz USVs during the testing phase of the 
      contextual conditioned fear, but not during the training session or the 
      open-field test (unconditioned fear stimuli). Catalepsy, on the other hand, 
      is the result of the blockage of D2 receptors in neural circuits associated 
      to motor behavior that appears to be dissociated from those directly linked 
      to dopamine-mediated neural mechanisms associated to fear.
