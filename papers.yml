      <p>
      Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes
      meningoencephalitis. There are no prophylactic tools for cryptococcosis.
      Previously, our group showed that a C. neoformans mutant lacking the gene
      encoding sterylglucosidase (Δsgl1) induced protection in both
      immunocompetent and immunocompromised murine models of cryptococcosis.
      Since sterylglucosidase catalyzes degradation of sterylglucosides (SGs),
      accumulation of this glycolipid could be responsible for protective
      immunity. In this study, we analyzed whether the activity of SGs is
      sufficient for the protective effect induced by the Δsgl1 strain. We
      observed that the accumulation of SGs impacted several properties of the
      main polysaccharide that composes the fungal capsule, glucuronoxylomannan
      (GXM). We therefore used genetic manipulation to delete the SGL1 gene in
      the acapsular mutant Δcap59 to generate a double mutant (strain
      Δcap59/Δsgl1) that was shown to be nonpathogenic and cleared from the
      lung of mice within 7 days post-intranasal infection. The inflammatory
      immune response triggered by the Δcap59/Δsgl1 mutant in the lung differed
      from the response seen with the other strains. The double mutant did not
      induce protection in a vaccination model, suggesting that SG-related
      protection requires the main capsular polysaccharide. Finally,
      GXM-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in SGs delayed the
      acute lethality of Galleria mellonella against C. neoformans infection.
      These studies highlighted a key role for GXM and SGs in inducing
      protection against a secondary cryptococcal infection, and, since EVs
      notoriously contain GXM, these results suggest the potential use of Δsgl1
      EVs as a vaccination strategy for cryptococcosis.

      <b>IMPORTANCE:</b> The number of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis is
      around 180,000 per year. The disease is the second leading cause of
      mortality among individuals with AIDS. Antifungal treatment is costly and
      associated with adverse effects and resistance, evidencing the urgency of
      development of both therapeutic and prophylactic tools. Here we
      demonstrate the key roles of polysaccharide- and glycolipid-containing
      structures in a vaccination model to prevent cryptococcosis.

      <p>
      Catalepsy – an immobile state in which individuals fail to change imposed
      postures – can be induced by haloperidol. In rats, the pattern of
      haloperidol-induced catalepsy is very similar to that observed in
      Parkinson’s disease (PD). As some PD symptoms seem to depend on the
      patient’s emotional state, and as anxiety disorders are common in PD, it
      is possible that the central mechanisms regulating emotional and
      cataleptic states interplay. Previously, we showed that haloperidol
      impaired contextual-induced alarm calls in rats, without affecting
      footshock-evoked calls. Here, we evaluated the influence of distinct
      aversive stimulations on the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. First, male
      Wistar rats were subjected to catalepsy tests to establish a baseline
      state after haloperidol or saline administration. Next, distinct cohorts
      were exposed to open-field; elevated plus-maze; open-arm confinement;
      inescapable footshocks; contextual conditioned fear; or corticosterone
      administration. Subsequently, catalepsy tests were performed again.
      Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was verified in all drug-treated animals.
      Exposure to open-field, elevated plus-maze, open-arm confinement,
      footshocks, or administration of corticosterone had no significant effect
      on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Contextual conditioned fear, which is
      supposed to promote a more intense fear, increased catalepsy over time.
      Our findings suggest that only specific defensive circuitries modulate
      the nigrostriatal system mediating the haloperidol-induced cataleptic
      state.
