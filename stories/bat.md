They picture me as scary.
<br> 
Just because I like to be upside down, and fly around at night.
<br>
I was always different, the only mammal who was able to fly.
<br>

Now, I’m trapped. 
<br>
Literally. 
<br>

The net is around my body. Would they lock me up? For what? 
<br>
Hours pass. 
<br>

As dawn approaches, a thick pair of gloves touch my fur. I’m doomed. 
<br>
I close my eyes and thrash. 
<br>
I try to bite.
<br>
They restrain me. And treat my wound. 
<br>

What? 
<br>

They attach a device and let me free. 
<br>
I think this time, I was the one to jump to conclusions.
