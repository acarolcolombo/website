Sometimes people say that you need to experience something in order to learn about it. Even if someone tells you how something feels, you will never understand it completely unless you change roles with them and actually live it.

It seems obvious and cliche, however I will tell you how one weird and amazing experience reminded me of this idea.

I had never thought that one day I would work as an “Easter Bunny” in an Easter festival.

Yeah, I know, it looks kind of creepy and weird, but I did it. And you know what? It was a funny opportunity to learn and think about many questions.

Raising basic questions

Why is a bunny the symbol of Easter? Why does it give eggs to children? Why does the tradition associate bunnies with eggs if they don't really lay eggs?

So, I googled it and discovered some interesting answers involving a lot of traditions and beliefs that are well-established in our society.

I would probably not have thought about these questions if I hadn't spent some time thinking about this specific topic. Have you ever thought about these questions before? Have you noticed​ that when you change roles​, some questions come out?

2. Famous for some hours

If you have ever thought of being​ a star and famous one day, I can tell you that it is hard. Everybody wants your attention, however you are just one person.

Many children love the Easter Bunny and try to get your attention to say hello. They want to take a picture with you, they want to hug you, they want to tell you about their wishes for easter night. Others don’t care at all. Some like the Easter Bunny but they are really afraid of the character. At the same time that they want to approach you, they cry and want to get away as soon as possible. But when they are leaving, they turn around to see you and wave goodbye. There are some kids that are curious about what is going on and ask you if you are real or just a character. Anyway, children are amazing! They are spontaneous and happy.

So, yeah, I was famous for some hours. There was a huge line to take pictures with me. Not with me, but with my character. Sometimes, that is the true in other cases. Many people are famous because of their characters and not because of what they really are. That is ok too. I just started to think about how our beliefs are associated with what we admire.

3. Watching from the eyes of another

When you are wearing a costume, you can see the world through its eyes (sometimes literally). You can see the world in another perspective. But you don’t need to put on a costume in order to have that experience. Sometimes you just need to change your role, even if it is just in your mind. You start to consider all the reasons that a person is living or had experienced to be where he/she is now.

A quick side note here. I am watching that Netflix serie “13 reasons why” that is based on the book with the same name written by Jay Asher. It shows a little bit how one story can have different perspectives, because it is all about who is living it, their beliefs, their history, their thoughts, their feelings.

Of course, I don’t know how a real bunny feels, but now I know how a person who uses a costume to entertain and take care of children feels. It is an amazing and incredible experience, with real-time feedback. You start watching parents behaving like kids to get a big smile from their children for a picture (some of them are too much); reactions of the children, their fears, beliefs and sincerity; how similar and different we are, different kinds of families whose goals are to give some joy to their kids; altruism and selfishness, some people worried about how tired and warm you are, unlike others who are mad because you asked for 2 minutes to take a break and they are just thinking about how long they have been in the line. These are just s few examples of what you could see from this costume.

However, it is important to say that it is hard work. The costume is big, warm, and awkward. Children come and sit on your lap, independently of their sizes. And worst, some adults do the same. It is exhausting.

I am glad that I experienced this and now I know how it is. I have a better idea of what this profession is responsible for and the difficulties that surround it. The important thing is always to try different jobs, activities, hobbies. You will learn a lot, even if it is just to say “I will never do this again”.

Have you ever looked through the eyes of another?

4. Of what I am capable

Yes, I did it! I am capable of doing this. I thought that I was not good enough to deal with the new and uncertain. This was my first job not related with my field of study. And now I know that I can do different things. It doesn’t mean that I will work as an Easter Bunny, but it does mean that I am ready to try distinct professions. Are you capable of doing something new?

In the end, I laughed a lot!

PS: I shared this experience, thoughts, and laughs with a great friend of mine that was there and took turns with me during one day. She also knows how to be an Easter Bunny now.
