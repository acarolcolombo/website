Time isnâ€™t the same for everyone... 

A year has passed by 
<br>
And our little caterpillar
<br>
Has became a butterfly 

Remembrances of lullabies
<br> 
Holding you in our arms
<br>
Admiring your big eyes
<br>
With all of your charms

And your chubby cheeks...

You were so small
<br>
Like a cute doll
<br>

Now look at you...

Brave and curious
<br>
Walking around 
<br>
Babbling about 
<br>
We are so proud

That feeling of trusting 
<br>
And our connection 
<br>
Gave us a certainty that you are ready to fly
<br>
Just need a little guide

You changed so much... 

Funny to think 
<br>
How in a blink
<br>
You went from crawling 
<br>
To unsteady walking

Glad to be there...

For every little step
<br>
Of your precious development
<br>
Growing to be independent

We just want you to know
<br>
You can be whatever you want
<br>
Be true to yourself and trust
<br> 
We love you, baby Yara, so much.
