There was no precision
<br>
Just love and intuition

She used to cook every meal
<br>
That these pages might reveal

Her gas stove set in Brazil
<br>
Brings the secrets of family meals

The recipes were written by her hands
<br>
Changing perspectives and flavours in every kitchen it lands

Now, an induction cooktop
<br>
And an avalanche of memories nonstop

Maize grits and boiling water
<br>
And I can hear her voice as a reminder

“You just need some bits
<br>
Bits of salt,
<br>
Bits of butter,
<br>
Bits of patience,
<br>
Bits of balance...”

Her touches and tips
<br>
Were in the delicious polenta captured by her great granddaugher’s mouth and bib.
